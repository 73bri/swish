<p>
The <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> chat services allows you to chat with
users about a file. <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> displays an <i>avatar</i> for each user
with whom you share an open file.  If you select <b>File/Chat ...</b>
the current notebook or program gets a chat window displayed below it,
preloaded with older chat messages about this file.

<p class="dropup">
The <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Send <b class="caret"></b></a>
button provides additional options such as <b>sending your current query</b>,
which appears as a button in the chat.

<h2 id="chat-status">Status of the SWISH sharing service</h2>

<p>
What you are seeing are the first steps to allow users of SWISH to communicate.
There are many facilities we have in mind, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connect editors for collaborative editing
  <li>Make <i>teams</i> that connect people also if they are not editing
      the same file.
  <li>Allow Prolog programs to exchange messages through the chat room.
</ul>
