<p>
The <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> chat services allows you to chat with
users that are looking <b>at the same file as you are</b>. <span
style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span>
displays an <i>avatar</i> for each user with whom you share an open
file.  This group of users defines your <i>dynamic</i> chat room.
</p>

<p>
The chat facility runs on top of the <i>web socket</i> interface.
Currently, chat messages are simply broadcasted. They are not remembered
by the server.

<h2 id="chat-status">Status of the SWISH sharing service</h2>

<p>
What you are seeing are the first steps to allow users of SWISH to communicate.
There are many facilities we have in mind, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share queries
  <li>Connect editors for collaborative editing
  <li>Make <i>teams</i> that connect people also if they are not editing
      the same file.
  <li>Allow Prolog to exchange messages through the chat room.
</ul>
