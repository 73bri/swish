<span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> is inspired by web-based tools such as <a
target="_blank" href="http://jsfiddle.net/">JSFIDDLE</a> in that it
allows you to develop a program and then share it with others on the
Web. However, lacking both debugger and profiler, <span
style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> is
far from a full-fledged IDE for Prolog, and to avoid compromising the
server it does not allow you to execute "dangerous" predicates such as
predicates reading and writing files. It does however allow you to use
predicates such as <code>read/1</code> and <code>write/1</code> but they
will only read from and write to your web browser.

<p>
We intend to make <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> useful in an educational setting. For
example, if you are a teacher, you may want to tell your students to
share with you the solutions to exercises by sending you a link to <span
style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span>
loaded with their solutions ready to run. There is still work to do
before this is a good alternative to a local installation though.

<h2 id="browsers">Supported browsers</h2>
<p>
<span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> works fine recent versions of in Safari,
Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer (tested IE 11).

<h2 id="swishapp">Adding SWISH to your application</h2>
<p>
<span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> can be added easily to any SWI-Prolog web
application. For example, it is available as an extension pack for <a
target="_blank" href="http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org/">ClioPatria</a>,
the SWI-Prolog RDF framework. It can be added to ClioPatria using the
command below, providing an alternative for SPARQL for exploring the
database (requires SWI-Prolog 7.1.23 or later).

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>
<span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> is implemented as a set of <a
target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugins, using <a
target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for menus,
modal windows and various styling aspects and <a target="_blank"
href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> for editing the Prolog
source and query. Queries are executed by sending both the source text
(left editor) and query (bottom-right editor) to the server, which
creates a <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pengines">Pengine</a>
(<i>Prolog Engine</i>) to execute the query.

<p>
Pengines have many other applications, such as supporting Prolog RPC
(<i>Remote Procedure Calls</i>, which allows you to execute a query
fully transparent, including backtracking, on a remote server. An
interesting aspect is that they provide a generic query language on top
of an arbitrary Prolog program that can be used from JavaScript. A <a
target="_blank" href="http://pengines.swi-prolog.org/">demo is
available</a>

<h2 id="source_code">Source code</h2>
<p>
The source code for <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> is available on <a target="_blank"
